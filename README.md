## Overview

This challenge was tougher for me. 

- When I initially started styling the page in my browser I didn't realize that the zoom with on 90%
- I also struggled a bit on the responsiveness in the media query.

I'm pretty sure the overall responsiveness of this challenge isn't the best so any feedback would be much appreciated. Thank you!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
